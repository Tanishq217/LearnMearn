>>>>> MVC, or Model-View-Controller, is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the Model (data and business logic), the View (user interface), and the Controller (handles user input and application flow).  <<<<<




1. Model:

Manages the application's data and business logic. 
Handles data fetching, storing, and manipulation. 
Can include rules and validation for its properties. 


2. View:

Responsible for displaying the data to the user. 
Contains templates for how information is presented. 
Provides the user interface that users interact with. 


3. Controller:

Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. 
Receives user input and handles requests. 
Interprets user input, manipulates the Model, and updates the View. 





!!! WITH BACKEND WE WILL BE USING THE MODEL AND CONTROLLER AND WHEN WE WILL MAKE THE FRONTEND WE WILL MAKE THE USE OF VIEW !!!
